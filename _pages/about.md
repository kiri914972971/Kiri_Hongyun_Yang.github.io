Hi, I’m **Kiri Yang**. I’m currently pursuing an MSc in **Business Information Systems**.  
I’m interested in roles related to **Business Data Analysis** and **Product**, and I enjoy turning messy data into clear business decisions.

### What I focus on
- **Business & Data Analysis**: finding patterns, building models, and translating results into actions  
- **Product Thinking**: understanding user needs and making practical recommendations  
- **Data Visualization**: dashboards and storytelling for decision-making  

### Tools
Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SAS Enterprise Miner, Tableau, Excel (Power Query, Pivot)
